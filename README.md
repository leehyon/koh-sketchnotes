# Koh Sketchnotes

This repository primarily assists in my note-taking system, such as for notes that are not suitable for plain text or for creating accompanying illustrations that aid in understanding. I use this repository to keep track of them, and it also encourages me to diversify my note-taking system since traditional text-based notes have their limitations.

However, it's worth mentioning that this doesn't involve traditional manual sketching. It's still important to ensure efficiency by utilizing certain tools, simplifying complexities, and enhancing productivity, rather than drawing for the sake of aesthetics.

## Motivation

Sketchnoting, or visual note-taking, is a technique that combines images, symbols, and diagrams with traditional text-based note-taking to enhance understanding and retention of information. It helps to visually represent complex ideas, relationships, and concepts in a more engaging and memorable way.

Just as a Chinese saying goes: "一图胜千言", meaning: A picture is worth a thousand words.

## The tools I use to create sketchnotes

### Draw.io

[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) is the first tool I'd like to recommend. It's free and has an online version that you can use instantly. For most of the diagrams, I use Draw.io to create them. It provides a wide range of shapes and graphic components to let you create unique diagrams.

### XMind 8

There are two main editions of Xmind, which are XMind 8 and Xmind. XMind 8 is a legacy edition with a lifetime license available to purchase, while the latest Xmind is a subscription-based edition. XMind 8 offers a basic version that can be used for free. For me, the basic features are already sufficient, so there's no need to upgrade.

### Excalidraw

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a virtual whiteboard for sketching hand-drawn like diagrams. It's open-source, and react-based. This is a treasure software that I recently discovered. After a short trial, it seems quite good and worth a try.

Another cool thing is, just like Draw.io, Excalidraw also offers a web version. Open up your browser and head over to [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/) to try it out.

### Mobile Apps

On the mobile end, I mainly use an iPad to assist in drawing some notes. Currently, the two apps I'm using are:

- [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/)
- [Freeform](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/freeform/id6443742539)

I bought GoodNotes 5 at a discounted price earlier, and using it for PDF annotation, drawing, and whiteboarding has been quite good. However, the latest version 6 has been released. Version 5 cannot be upgraded directly. I will observe for a while first, after all, I have found an alternative - Apple's own Freeform. For me, I still tend to use Apple's application for those that can be used within the Apple ecosystem.

### VSCode Extensions

While direct sketchnoting is a good option, sometimes I also want to generate graphics directly through code. On the one hand, this helps in version control and tracking. On the other hand, I want to integrate it into my own code development workflow. The VSCode extension marketplace offers many excellent solutions, and of course, many of them are also available as standalone web applications. Here, I primarily use the following two extensions:

- [Markmap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode)
- [PlantUML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml)

## Tips for beginners

To effectively incorporate sketchnoting into traditional note-taking, here are some tips:

1. Use symbols and icons: Develop a set of symbols or icons that represent specific ideas or concepts. This will help to simplify and condense information, making it easier to digest and remember.
2. Create diagrams and mind maps: Use diagrams, flowcharts, or mind maps to visually represent relationships and connections between different concepts. This can help to identify patterns and understand the bigger picture.
3. Use color strategically: Color-coding different sections or categories can help to organize information and make it visually appealing. Use colors to highlight key points or emphasize important information.
4. Incorporate sketches and drawings: Use simple drawings or sketches to illustrate ideas or concepts. This can help to reinforce understanding and make the information more memorable.
5. Combine text and visuals: While visuals are important, it's essential to include relevant text alongside them. Use short phrases or keywords to provide context and reinforce the meaning of the visuals.

Sketchnoting is a personal process, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. Experiment with different techniques and find a style that works best for you.
